How to make it run
------------------

#ifdef GENERIC
Extract the zip file into some directory and run PicoDrive from there.
#endif
#ifdef GP2X
Extract all files to some directory on your SD and run PicoDrive.gpe from your
GP2X/Wiz/Caanoo menu. The same .gpe supports GP2X F100/F200, Wiz and Caanoo,
there is no need to use separate versions.
#endif
#ifdef GIZ
First make sure you have homebrew-enabled Service Pack installed. Then copy
PicoDrive.exe and KGSDK.dll to any place in your filesystem (both files must
be in the same directory) and run PicoDrive.exe using the launcher of your choice
(some of them might require renaming PicoDrive.exe to Autorun.exe, placing it in
the root of SD, etc).
#endif
#ifdef PSP
If you are running a custom firmware, just copy the whole PicoDrive directory to
/PSP/GAME or /PSP/GAMEXXX directory in your memory stick (it shouldn't matter
which one GAME* directory to use).
#endif
#ifdef PANDORA
Just copy the .pnd to <sd card>/pandora/menu or <sd card>/pandora/desktop.
#endif

Then load a ROM and enjoy! Cartridge ROMs can be in various common formats and
can be zipped, one ROM file per zip. Certain extensions are used to detect the
console the ROM is for (.sg, .sc, .sms, .gg, .smd, .md, .gen, .32x, .pco).
For MSU games, load the .cue file and make sure the cartridge ROM has the same
name and is in the same directory.
Sega/Mega CD images can be in CHD, CUE+BIN/ISO or ISO/CSO+MP3/WAV format (read
below for more details).

This emulator has lots of options with various tweaks (for improved speed mostly),
but it should have best compatibility in it's default config. If suddenly you
start getting glitches or change something and forget what, use "Restore defaults"
option.


How to run Sega/Mega CD games
-----------------------------

To play any non-MSU CD game you need BIOS files. These files must be copied to
#ifdef PANDORA
<sd card>/pandora/appdata/picodrive/ directory
(if you run PicoDrive once it will create that directory for you).
#else
#ifdef GENERIC
the .picodrive directory in your home directory.
#else
the same directory as PicoDrive files.
#endif
#endif
Files must be named as follows:

US: us_scd1_9210.bin, us_scd2_9306.bin, SegaCDBIOS9303.bin
EU: eu_mcd1_9210.bin, eu_mcd2_9303.bin, eu_mcd2_9306.bin
JP: jp_mcd1_9112.bin, jp_mcd1_9111.bin
these files can also be zipped.

The game must be dumped to CHD, CUE+BIN or CUE+ISO format.
ISO/CSO+MP3/WAV is also supported, but may cause problems.
When using CUE/BIN, you must load .cue file from the menu, or else the emu will
not find audio tracks.


How to run Sega Pico games
--------------------------

The Pico was special in that it had a large touchpad with an associated pen, and
so-called storyware, a combination of a cartridge with a book with up to 6 pages
on which the pen could also be used.

Most storywares used the touchpad with the pen as a pointer device, showing a
pointer icon on the screen when the pen was on the touchpad which could be moved
around. The pen has a dedicated button which was often used to select something
under the pointer icon, much like a mouse button.
However, a few games also had an overlay for the touchpad.

PicoDrive supports displaying both the storyware pages as well as a pad overlay.
They must be in png format and named like the storyware ROM without the
extension, plus "_<n>.png" for the storyware page <n>, and "_pad.png" for a pad
overlay. Storyware page images should have an aspect ration of 2:1, pad images
should have 4:3. All images can have arbitrary resolution and are automatically
scaled to fit the screen.

There are 2 menu actions for switching to pages or pad which will automatically
display the images if they are available. To allow for proper pen positioning
there is also an action for having the pen on the page/touchpad or not. Pen
positioning is done through the D-pad if the screen has been switched to either
pages or pad.


Other important stuff
---------------------

* Sega/Mega CD: If the background music is missing, the CD image format may be
  wrong. Currently .cue/bin or .chd is recommended. Be aware that there are
  lots of bad dumps on the web, and some use mp3 format for audio, which often
  causes problems (see below).
* While iso/mp3 format is supported, it's not recommended to use.
  Some of many problems with mp3 are listed below:
  * MP3s may be named incorrectly and will not play.
  * The game music may play too fast/too slow/out of sync, which means they
    are encoded incorrectly. PicoDrive is not a mp3 player, so all mp3s MUST
    be encoded at 44.1kHz stereo.
* Sega/Mega CD: If your games hang at the BIOS screen (with planets shown),
  you may be using a bad BIOS dump. Try another from a different source,
  like dumping it from your own console.
#ifdef GP2X
* When using mp3s, use lower bitrate for better performance (96 or 128kbps
  CBRs recommended).
* GP2X F100/F200: When you use both GP2X CPUs, keep in mind that you can't
  overclock as high as when using ARM920 only. For example my GP2X when run
  singlecore can reach 280MHz, but with both cores it's about 250MHz. When
  overclocked too much, it may start hanging and producing random noise, or
  causing ARM940 crashes ("940 crashed" message displayed).
* GP2X F100/F200: Due to internal implementation mp3s must not be larger that
  12MB (12582912 bytes). Larger mp3s will not be fully loaded.

Wiz only: works around the tearing problem by using portrait mode. Causes ~5-10%
performance hit, but eliminates the tearing effect.

@@2. "Vsync"
This one adjusts the LCD refresh rate to better match game's refresh rate and

@@2. "Scanline mode"
This option was designed to work around slow framebuffer access (the Gizmondo's
main bottleneck) by drawing every other line (even numbered lines only).
This improves performance greatly, but looses detail.

@@2. "Scale low res mode"
The Genesis/Mega Drive had several graphics modes, some of which were only 256
pixels wide. This option scales their width to 320 by using simple
pixel averaging scaling. Works only when 16bit renderer is enabled.

@@2. "Double buffering"
Draws the display to offscreen buffer, and flips it with visible one when done.
Unfortunately this causes serious tearing, unless v-sync is used (next option).

@@4. "Renderer"
#ifdef GP2X
8bit fast:
This enables alternative heavily optimized tile-based renderer, which renders
pixels not line-by-line (this is what accurate renderers do), but in 8x8 tiles,
which is much faster. But because of the way it works it can't render any
mid-frame image changes (raster effects), so it is useful only with some games.

Other two are accurate line-based renderers. The 8bit is faster but does not
run well with some games like Street Racer.
#endif
#ifdef GIZ
This option allows to switch between 16bit and 8bit renderers. The 8bit one is
a bit faster for some games, but not much, because colors still need to be
converted to 16bit, as this is what Gizmondo requires. It also introduces
graphics problems for some games, so it's best to use 16bit one.
#endif
#ifdef PSP
This option allows to switch between fast and accurate renderers. The fast one
is much faster, because it draws the whole frame at a time, instead of doing it
line by line, like the accurate one does. But because of the way it works it
can't render any mid-frame image changes (raster effects), so it is useful only
for some games.

Select "Configure controls" from the options menu. Then selecting "Player <n>"
will display 2 columns. The left column lists names of Genesis/MD controller
buttons, the right column shows which key on your handheld is assigned to it.

There is also option to enable 6 button pads (will allow you to configure XYZ
buttons), and an option to set turbo rate (in Hz) for turbo buttons.

Players 3 and 4 can only be used if a 4 player adapter is selected for input
device 1, and the game is supporting this. Only 3 button pads are currently
supported in 4 player mode.


Cheat support
-------------

To use GG/patch codes, you must type them into your favorite text editor, one
per line. Comments may follow code after a whitespace. Only GameGenie and
Genecyst patch formats are supported.
Examples:

Genecyst patch (this example is for Sonic):

00334A:0005 Start with five lives
012D24:0001 Keep invincibility until end of stage
009C76:5478 each ring worth 2
009C76:5678 each ring worth 3
...

Game Genie patch (for Sonic 2):

ACLA-ATD4 Hidden palace instead of death egg in level select
...

Both GG and patch codes can be mixed in one file.

When the file is ready, name it just like your ROM file, but with additional
.pat extension, making sure that case matches.

Examples:

ROM: Sonic.zip
PATCH FILE: Sonic.zip.pat

ROM: Sonic 2.bin
PATCH FILE: Sonic 2.bin.pat

Put the file into your ROMs directory. Then load the .pat file as you would
a ROM. Then Cheat Menu Option should appear in main menu.

Problems / limitations
----------------------

#ifdef PSP
* SVP emulation is terribly slow.
#endif
* Various VDP modes and quirks (window bug, scroll size 2, etc.) are not
  perfectly emulated, as very few games use this (if any at all).
* The emulator is designed for speed and not 100% accurate, so some things may
  not work as expected.
* The FM sound core doesn't support all features and has some accuracy issues.
